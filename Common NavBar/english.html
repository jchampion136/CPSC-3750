    <p>Throughout Claudia Rankines <em>Citizen</em>, Rankine sheds light on the microaggressions imposed on African American citizens in modern day society. Her narrative is generally from the perspective of those who endure these forms of racism. Traditionally, this approach feels more personal to the audience, as they are directly engaged in these experiences in microaggression. In the poem <em>Making Room</em>, Rankine takes a different approach on the issue of microaggressions by placing the vantage point on the experiences and responses of a bystander. So why does Rankine write this passage from the point of view of a witness of microaggressions and how does the tone of the passage change compared to other poems told from the perspective of the victim?</p>
    <p>In this poem, Rankine uses this perspective to shed light on the role and responsibilities of an observer experiencing microaggressive scenarios. In doing this, Rankine also captures the reactions and responses of the victim that are more vivid and descriptive to the reader. As the narrative unfolds, the speaker observes the mans response to the narrators action of sitting in the neighboring train seat. Rankines use of contrasting imagery such as the word darkness accurately describes the mans discomfort. This choice of language conveys an emotional resonance throughout the scene that a first-person account could not. Instead, the reader is allowed to experience these moments the victim experiences through the eyes of an observer. In addition to this, Rankine also brings focus on the actions of morally conscientious bystanders, individuals who recognize the social injustice and mistreatment of African American citizens and respond appropriately. The speaker does this by occupying the empty seat next to the man and even curates a story that they are traveling together if someone asks her to move.</p>
    <p>Overall, the change in perspective creates a tone that feels more optimistic in comparison to Rankines other passages on microaggressions. By focusing on the actions of morally upright bystanders, Rankine points out that while microaggressions continue to exist, there are other people in society who recognize discrimination for what it is and will act accordingly to combat it. This notion offers hope for a more empathetic and just future society free of hate and discrimination.</p>
    <p>One of the most powerful images in <em>Citizen</em> is the white mob witnessing the lynching of two Black Americans. Why does Rankine take the victims out of the picture and how does this removal change the readers attitude towards the image?</p>
    <p>At first glance, the image seems innocent, depicting a community event or a casual backyard cookout. The focal point of the image is initially a man pointing to something unseen, perhaps it has been lost with the age of the picture or rather something was deliberately removed. The true nature of the image and its tone is drastically changed when you realize its original context. The most disturbing element is the reactions of the spectators present. They are all smiling and showing enjoyment with the events taking place. The image is barely a century old, serving as a chilling reminder of socially tolerated acts of violence occurring recently in our history.</p>
    <p>By removing the lynching victims in the photo, Rankine can shift the focus of the photo from pure violence to the reactions of the crowd. This diversion forces readers to face the reality that such heinous acts of terror against African Americans were merely forms of entertainment.</p>
    <p>Both the Duluth lynching image and Rankines <em>Making Room</em> <br> shift the focus of racial discrimination from the victim to the spectator. The impact of an observer is critical to the fight against discrimination and towards social justice.</p>
